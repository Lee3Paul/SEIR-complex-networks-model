# SIR complex networks model

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of three compartmentsâ€“ S for the number susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number recovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps and rubella.

This implementation uses complex networks instead of  differential equations.

Works great with Python 2.7 .
